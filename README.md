## üìÑ Project Description

<p align="justify">
The <strong>QR Code Based Metro Ticketing System</strong> is designed to simplify metro station operations by eliminating the need for physical tickets. It generates a unique QR code for users upon each trip and records station entry and exit data when users scan their codes at respective gates. Fares are automatically calculated based on predefined rates and deducted from the user's account balance.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The system leverages <strong>secure QR codes</strong> and <strong>real-time caching</strong> to provide a <strong>fast, reliable, and secure</strong> metro experience for passengers. The architecture emphasizes high performance with Redis caching and SQL Server for data persistence.
